# Version Injection Loop Issue - FIXED âœ…

## Problem Identified
The development server console was spammed with hundreds of repeated messages:
```
ðŸ”§ Injecting version into HTML: 1.0.1760564737567
ðŸ”§ Injecting version into HTML: 1.0.1760564737567
ðŸ”§ Injecting version into HTML: 1.0.1760564737567
(repeated 300+ times)
```

### Root Cause
In `vite-plugins/inject-version.ts`, the `transformIndexHtml` hook was logging on **every transform call**:

- Vite's HMR (Hot Module Replacement) triggers multiple transformations
- Each file change causes the HTML to be transformed again
- The plugin logged every single transformation
- During development, this could happen dozens or hundreds of times

```typescript
// OLD CODE - Logged every time
transformIndexHtml(html) {
  console.log('ðŸ”§ Injecting version into HTML:', version);
  return html.replace('{{BUILD_VERSION}}', version);
}
```

## Solution Applied âœ…

### Added Logging Guard
Implemented a `hasLogged` flag to ensure the message only appears once:

```typescript
// NEW CODE - Logs only once
export function injectVersion() {
  const version = `1.0.${Date.now()}`;
  let hasLogged = false;
  
  return {
    name: 'inject-version',
    transformIndexHtml(html) {
      // Only log once to avoid spam during hot reload
      if (!hasLogged) {
        console.log('ðŸ”§ Version injected into HTML:', version);
        hasLogged = true;
      }
      return html.replace('{{BUILD_VERSION}}', version);
    },
  };
}
```

## Current Status
âœ… **Fixed** - Version injection log appears only once
âœ… **Functionality Preserved** - Version still injected correctly
âœ… **Clean Console** - No more log spam during development

## Impact
- **Before**: 300+ log messages on each hot reload cycle
- **After**: 1 log message per server restart
- **Console Readability**: Significantly improved

## Testing
After the fix is applied:
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Check console output
3. Should see only ONE version injection message
4. Make file changes and save
5. Hot reload occurs with no additional version logs

## Related Issues Fixed
1. âœ… Audio file error loop (fixed in `phoneNotificationService.ts`)
2. âœ… Version injection log spam (fixed in `inject-version.ts`)

## Files Modified
- `vite-plugins/inject-version.ts` - Added logging guard

## Performance Impact
- **Minimal**: Only affects console output
- **No runtime impact**: Version injection still works normally
- **Developer Experience**: Much cleaner console during development

## Date Fixed
October 15, 2025

## Notes
- This is a development-only issue (doesn't affect production builds)
- The version injection functionality remains unchanged
- Only the logging behavior was modified
- Can still see version in browser DevTools or by checking `window.__APP_VERSION__`
